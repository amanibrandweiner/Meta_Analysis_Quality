# Quality of the meta-analysis <br>
### MAGIC CRITERIA <br>
• Magnitude – How big is the effect? Large effects are more compelling than
small ones. <br> <br>
• Articulation – How specific is it? Precise statements are more compelling than
imprecise ones. <br> <br>
• Generality – How generally does it apply? More general effects are more
compelling than less general ones. Claims that would interest a more general
audience are more compelling. <br> <br>
• Interestingness – interesting effects are those that "have the potential, through
empirical analysis, to change what people believe about an important issue". In
other words, are the results relevant! <br> <br>
• Credibility – Credible claims are more compelling than incredible ones. The
researcher must show that the claims made are credible. <br> <br>
